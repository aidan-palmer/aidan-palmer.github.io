## Advent of Code 2025 Day 5 Walkthrough

### [Part 1](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/5)

Today I'm switching things up and doing this puzzle in C# instead of C++. I'm doing this because I just found out that I will have a job interview next week that will have a technical portion that will evaluate how competent I am at C#, among other technical skills. So now I'm using Advent of Code as a chance to brush up on my C# skills and try not to mix it up with Java, which I know better than C# and is scarily similar.

Part 1 is not too complicated. In fact, the hardest part seems to be parsing the input text:
```c#
StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(args[0]);
line = sr.ReadLine();
while (line != null)
{
    if (line.Length == 0)
    {
        first = false;
    } else
    {
        if (first)
        {
            int dash = line.IndexOf('-');
            long x = long.Parse(line.Substring(0, dash));
            long y = long.Parse(line.Substring(dash + 1));
            Tuple<long, long> t = new Tuple<long, long>(x, y);
            ranges.Add(t);
        } else
        {
            ids.Add(long.Parse(line));
        }
    }
    line = sr.ReadLine();
}
```
The goal here is to put the ID ranges into a list of tuples, and the available ID's into a list of ints. Then it's time to loop through the available ID's and check whether or not that ID is considered "fresh":
```c#
long total = 0;
foreach (long i in ids)
{
    if (IsFresh(i))
    {
        total++;
    }
}
```
Now all we have to do is setup the logic to check if each id is within one of the ranges:
```c#
static bool IsFresh(long id)
{
    foreach (Tuple<long, long> t in ranges)
    {
        if (id >= t.Item1 && id <= t.Item2)
        {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```
For me, the hardest part of this puzzle was remembering how to do all the things I normally do in C++ and translate that to C#. Thankfully I've done some previous Advent of Code puzzles in C#, so I already had a starter file setup and knew how to do things like parsing input that are sometimes unique to AoC.
Anyways, on to Part 2!

### Part 2

Part 2 is trickier than it first looks. The problem would be easy if we didn't have to take into account overlapping ranges of numbers, which means that one approach is to figure out how to get rid of the overlapping ranges and merge ranges that overlap together. Once we can figure that out, then counting up the total ranges becomes trivial. We can make the whole process easier for ourselves by sorting our list of tuples based on the start of each range:
```c#
ranges.Sort((t1, t2) => t1.Item1.CompareTo(t2.Item1));
```
This will help simplify the logic needed to merge the ranges together, and probably makes it more efficient as well. Now it's time to merge all of the ranges together so that we get rid of any overlapping ones:
```c#
static void MergeRanges()
{
    for (int i = 0; i < ranges.Count - 1; i++)
    {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < ranges.Count; j++)
        {
            if (ranges[j].Item1 <= ranges[i].Item2)
            {
                if (ranges[j].Item2 > ranges[i].Item2)
                {
                    Tuple<long, long> t = new Tuple<long, long>(ranges[i].Item1, ranges[j].Item2);
                    ranges[i] = t;
                }
                ranges.RemoveAt(j);
                j--;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Now all that's left to do is calculate each range's difference and add them all up:
```c#
static long CountFresh()
{
    long total = 0;
    foreach (Tuple<long, long> t in ranges)
    {
        total += t.Item2 - t.Item1 + 1;
    }
    return total;
}
```
That's it for Day 5. You can find the full source code for today's puzzle [here](https://github.com/aidan-palmer/advent-of-code/tree/main/2025/Day5).
This is the last write up I'm doing for this year's Advent of Code. I'm just too busy to keep writing these with final exams coming up, and these puzzles are also becoming harder and more time consuming. I'll keep working on them, and you can look at my progress by checking out my [Github](https://github.com/aidan-palmer/advent-of-code).
Merry Christmas!

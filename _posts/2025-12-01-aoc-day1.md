## Advent of Code 2025 Day 1 Walkthrough

It's that time of year again, time for Advent of Code. If you've never heard of Advent of Code, check out my [post](https://aidan-palmer.github.io/2024/12/14/aoc.html) from last year when I got really into it. This year I am going to do write-ups of each day with an explanation of the process for solving each puzzle. At least, I am going to do them until the puzzles inevitably become too hard for me at some point, which will happen a little sooner than normal since this year there will unfortunately only be 12 days of puzzles, not the usual 25. It is completely understandable that the creator of Advent of Code is burnt out and doesn't want to make so many puzzles any more, but it is still a little disapointing nevertheless. Anyways, on to the puzzles!

### [Part 1](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/1)

As is typical of the first few days of Advent of Code, this puzzle seems pretty straightforward and easy. We're given a sequence of rotations to make on a safe's dial lock, and have to keep track of the dial's position after each rotation and count the number of times it hits 0. We'll start by parsing the input text file, which should be very easy in this case:
```c++
while (getline(file, line)) {
    char dir = line[0];
    int dist = stoi(line.substr(1));
}
```
Yes, I am doing this and all other puzzles this year in C++, the best programming language for AoC and competitive programming.
Now that we've got our data parsed, it's time to figure out the algorithm for simulating the dial rotations:
```c++
int dial = 50;
int zeros = 0;
while (getline(file, line)) {
    char dir = line[0];
    int dist = stoi(line.substr(1));
    if (dir == 'L') {
        dial -= dist;
    } else {
        dial += dist;
    }
    while (dial < 0) {
        dial += 100;
    }
    while (dial > 99) {
        dial -= 100;
    }
    if (dial == 0) {
        zeros++;
    }
}
```
This actually turned out to be a little bit tricky. I initially did not take into account rotations that were larger than 100, because there weren't any in the example, but I saw there were some large rotations in the input file, so I went from using if statements for dial < 0 and dial > 99, and changed them to while loops so that they work for larger rotations.

### Part 2

At first look Part 2 doesn't look too complicated, and I thought that I would just need to increment the zeros counter in each while loop. That turned out to not be the case, and after completely rewriting my code and banging my head against the wall for a while, I have temporarily given up on Part 2. I guess compressing Advent of Code down to only 12 days means that the first few days will not be easy after all.
